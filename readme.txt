Upgrade your content workflow. Collaborate with your editorial team right inside WordPress.

== Description ==

Editor streamlines the collaboration of your editorial workflow by allowing your team members to suggest changes (revisions) to your WordPress posts.

Admin users get tp compare and see all changes to posts as proposed by the editorial team. Admin users approve or reject the changes.

**How it works**

Editor allows the members of your editorial team to "fork" a post to create a revision. While your team edits and suggests various changes to a post, the original post remains unchanged.

Admin users can see and compare the changes and "merge" the revision post into the original post.

**Examples**

- Allow your editorial team to suggest a new featured image for a post.
- Allow your editorial team to edit the post content and the post excerpt.
- Allow your editorial team to suggest a new post slug. Your original post will retain the original slug until you are ready to merge your contributor's suggestion. Once merged, the old slug will redirect to the new slug automatically.

**How to use Editor**

Each post can be "forked" by your contributors.

Admin users can compare the forked post with the original post and see the changes:

- If the post title was changed
- If the post slug was changed
- If the post content was changed
- If the post excerpt was changed
- If the featured image was changed

Admin users can "merge" the forked post into the original post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. What is a fork?

 A fork is a duplicate of the original post that you can use to edit without fearing what happens to your published, public post.

 When you fork a post, your published post stays the same - unchanged. You can do your edits on the forked post and, when ready, merge the forked post into the original post. 

2. Who are the contributors?

 By default, the plugin is available to all users. Only admin users have the ability to merge the forked post into the original post.
